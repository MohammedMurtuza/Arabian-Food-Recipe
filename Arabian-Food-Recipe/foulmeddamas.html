<p class="p1"><font color="white">INGREDIENTS<br><br>
2 cups small Egyptian fava beans (ful medames), soaked overnight (and left unpeeled)
Salt<br>
1/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
Extra-virgin olive oil<br>
3 lemons, quartered<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
4–6 cloves garlic, crushed
Chili-pepper flakes<br>
Cumin<br><br></p>
<p class="p1"><font color="white">PREPARATION<br><br>
As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve.<br> Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened.<br> They take 2–2 1/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. <br>It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce.
Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.<br>
Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.<br>
The beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing.</p>
