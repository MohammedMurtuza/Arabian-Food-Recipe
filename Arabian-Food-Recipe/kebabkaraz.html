Instructions<br><br>

Place ground meat in a large bowl. Add grated onion, spices and milk, and mix by hand until well incorporated.<br><br>

Form meat into 0.5oz balls, between the size of a quarter and ping pong ball.<br><br>

Place in a large skillet over high heat. No oil is needed because the fat from the meat will be enough. Cook about 5 min, turning them halfway through to brown both sides, but not to cook all the way through. (you will be cooking them again in the sauce).<br><br>

Cherry Sauce
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add both jars of cherries plus liquid. Add salt, cinnamon and lemon juice and stir together. Simmer for 30-45 min or until the sauce has reduced and becomes jammy in consistency.<br><br>

Once meatballs are done searing, add them to sauce and cover with the sauce and allow them to simmer together about 10 more min. where the meat will finish cooking.<br><br>

In a medium sized plate, arrange diamond cut pita around the outside perimeter of the plate and work your way in to the center so the whole plate is covered in the bread. Then top with the Cherry Kebab and sprinkle with parsley and pine nuts!<br><br>
