    <font color="white">Ingredients<br><br>
      - Dried chickpeas: AVOID using canned chickpeas! Dried chickpeas (that have been soaked in water for 24 hours) are
      an important ingredient that will give your falafel the right consistency and taste. (Tip: I usually add about �
      tsp of baking soda to the soaking water to help soften the dry chickpeas.)<br>

      - Fresh herbs: fresh parsley, cilantro, and dill are key to this authentic recipe.<br>

      - Onion: I typically use yellow onions, but white or red onions would work.<br>

      - Garlic: for best flavor, use fresh garlic cloves.<br>

      - Kosher salt and pepper: to taste.<br>

      - Spices: cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper. Along with the fresh herbs, this trio of spices is what
      gives falafel it's bold authentic taste.<br>

      - Baking powder: this is what gives falafel an airy, fluffy texture (many recipes skip this, causing the falafel
      to come out too dense.)<br>

      - Sesame seeds: these are optional here, but I do like the added nuttiness.

    <font color="white">How to Make Falafel: Step-by-Step<br><br>
      1. Soak chickpeas for 24 hours. Cover them in plenty of water and add baking soda to help soften them as they
      soak. The chickpeas will at least double in size as they soak. Drain very well.<br><br>
      2. Make mixture. Add chickpeas, fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and dill), garlic, onion, and spices to food
      processor and pulse a little bit at a time until the mixture is finely ground. You�ll know it�s ready when the
      texture is more like coarse meal.<br>

      & Refrigerate (important.) Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or
      overnight. The chilled mixture will hold together better, making it easier to form the falafel patties.

      3. Form patties or balls. Once the falafel mixture has been plenty chilled, stir in baking powder and toasted
      sesame seeds, then scoop golf ball-sized balls and form into balls or patties (if you go the patties route, do not
      flatten them too much, you want them to still be nice and fluffy when they're cooked.)

      4. Fry. Frying is the traditional way to cook falafel and yields the most authentic and best result. Heat the oil
      on medium-high until it bubbles softly (your oil should be hot enough around 375 degrees F, but not too hot that
      it causes the falafel to fall apart.)

      Carefully drop the falafel in the oil, using a slotted spoon, and fry for 3-5 minutes until medium brown on the
      outside. Avoid over-crowding the falafel; fry them in batches if necessary.<br><br>

      Tip: it's always a good idea to fry one falafel first to make sure the oil temperature does not need to be
      adjusted.

      You can serve falafel for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Most Egyptians, and others throughout the Middle East
      actually start their day with falafel, much like many here in the States start with a bowl of cereal.<br><br>

    <font color="white">Important Tips<br><br>
      I shared some of these earlier in the post, but just in case you missed them:<br><br>

      1. Always use dry chickpeas. Dry chickpeas, that have been soaked in water for 24 hours, will give you the best
      texture and flavor. Dry chickpeas are naturally starchy and will help your falafels to stay well formed. If you
      use canned chickpeas, your falafel will disintegrate in the frying oil.<br><br>

      2. Chill the falafel mixture. Chilling for at least 1 hour helps with the shaping. And good news is, you can make
      the falafel mixture one night in advance and chill overnight.<br><br>

      3. Add baking powder to the falafel mixture before forming into balls/patties. As a raising agent, baking powder
      here helps make the falafel on the fluffy side.<br><br>

      4. Fry in bubbling oil, and do not crowd the saucepan. For perfectly crispy falafel, sadly, the best option is
      deep frying. The cooking oil should be hot and gently bubbling, but not too hot that the falafel disintegrate. If
      you need to, use a deep fry-safe thermometer; it should read around 375 degrees F (for my stove, that is
      medium-high heat.)<br><br>

      5- Once cooked, falafel should be crispy and medium brown on the outside, fluffy and light green on the
      inside.<br><br>

      For baked falafel<br>
      Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and lightly oil a baking sheet. Give each patty a quick brush of extra virgin
      olive oil before baking; bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, turning the falafel patties over halfway through
      baking.<br><br>

      Make ahead and freezing<br><br><br>

      To make ahead: Prepared falafel mixture will keep in the fridge for 1-2 days ahead of time. Form it into patties
      when ready to fry.<br><br>

      To freeze: Place uncooked falafel patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for 1 hour. Once
      hardened, transfer the patties into a freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Falafel can be cooked from frozen
      by frying or baking.<br><br>
