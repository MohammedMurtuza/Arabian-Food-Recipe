      DIRECTIONS<br><br>
      In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and
      bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps �whip� or �cream� the tahini, making
      the hummus smooth and creamy<br><br>.How to Make <br><br><span
        class="p2">How-to-Make-Hummus-Recipe-Step-1</span><br><br>

      <font color="white">Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and
        lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 seconds or
        until well blended. Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and
        process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick
        and quite smooth; 1 to 2 minutes<br><br><span class="p2">How-to-Make-Hummus-Recipe-Step-2</span><br><br>

        Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food
        processor turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect
        consistency.<br><br><span class="p2">How-to-Make-Hummus-Recipe-Step-3</span><br>

        <br>Taste for salt and adjust as needed.<br><br>Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika.
        <br><br>Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week.
