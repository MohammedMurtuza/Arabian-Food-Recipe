    <font color="white">Ingredients<br>
      For the dough:<br><br>

      2 teaspoons active dry yeast.<br>
      1 teaspoon granulated sugar.<br>
      1 cup (240ml) warm water.<br><br>

      3 cups (405g) all purpose flour.<br>
      2 Tablespoons dry powdered milk.<br> Note1
      1 teaspoon salt.<br><br>

      1/4 cup olive oil.<br>
      For the cheese topping: (enough for 4)<br>
      You can choose any white cheese combination you like and here is what I�ve done<br>
      100 g Mozzarella cheese.<br>
      100 g feta cheese.<br>
      1 Tablespoon olive oil.<br>
      For the za�atar mix (enough for 4)<br>
      1/4 cup olive oil<br>
      1/4 cup za�atar mix.<br>
      1 Tablespoon water.<br><br>
  </p>

  <p class="p1">Instructions<br>
    Make the dough:<br><br>
    In your mixer bowl, combine yeast, sugar and half a cup of the warm water. Stir to combine and leave it to proof for
    10 minutes.<br><br>
    In a separate bowl, combine flour, dry milk and salt.<br><br>
    After the 10 minutes add oil and flour then start kneading adding the water little by little until a nice consistent
    dough is formed.<br><br>
    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise on you countertop until it doubled in size or for 1 hour depending
    on your kitchen temperature.<br><br>
    Preheat oven to 375F. Place a rack in the middle of the oven.<br><br>
    Line two large baking sheets (enough to hold two 8inch circles) with parchment paper.<br><br>
    Lightly flour your work surface and turn the dough in, divide the dough into 8 equal balls.<br><br>
    Work with one ball at a time and cover the rest with plastic wrap.<br><br>
    Roll the dough ball into a 8inch circle, lightly dust with flour while rolling so it will not stick to the work
    space.<br><br>
    Place the rolled dough on your baking sheet and work with another one then place it on the same baking
    sheet.<br><br>
    Top the circles with your za�atar or cheese mix and level the surface.<br><br>
    Bake for 12-15 minutes ( or longer for a crispier mannish if that�s what you like) or until the bottom of the
    manakish turns golden brown.<br><br>
    If you want them to stay soft place while hot on a plate and cover with plastic wrap.<br><br>
