    <font color="white">INGREDIENTS<br><br>
      1/2 cup bulgur<br>
      1 cup diced cucumber (1 small-to-medium)<br>
      1 cup diced tomato* (1 large)<br>
      1 teaspoon fine sea salt, divided<br>
      3 medium bunches curly parsley<br>
      1/3 cup (1/3 ounce) chopped fresh mint (optional but recommended�you can chop it in the food processor with the
      parsley)<br>
      1/3 cup thinly sliced green onion<br>
      1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
      3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice, to taste<br>
      1 medium clove garlic, pressed or minced<br>

    <font color="white">INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
      Cook or soak the bulgur until tender according to package directions. Drain off any excess water, and set aside to
      cool.
      Meanwhile, combine the diced cucumber and tomato in a medium bowl with � teaspoon of the salt. Stir, and let the
      mixture rest for at least 10 minutes, or until you�re ready to mix the salad.
      To prepare the parsley, cut off the thick stems. Then, finely chop the parsley and remaining stems�you can do this
      by hand, but it�s much easier in a food processor with the standard �S� blade. Process 1 bunch at a time (it
      should yield about 1 cup chopped), transferring the chopped parsley to a large serving bowl before proceeding with
      the next.
      Add the cooled bulgur, chopped fresh mint (if using) and green onion to the bowl of parsley. Strain off and
      discard the cucumber and tomato juice that has accumulated in the bottom of the bowl (this ensures that your
      tabbouleh isn�t too watery). Add the strained cucumber and tomato to the bowl.
      In a small measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, garlic, and remaining �
      teaspoon salt. Pour it into the salad and stir to combine. Taste, and adjust if necessary�add another tablespoon
      of lemon juice for zing, or salt for more overall flavor.
      If you have the time, let the salad rest for 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors mingle. Otherwise, you
      can serve it immediately or chill it for later. Tabbouleh will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4
      days.<br><br>
      NOTES<br><br>
      MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Bulgur is not gluten free (it�s cracked wheat). Substitute quinoa for an untraditional
      gluten-free option. You�ll use the same amount (� cup) uncooked quinoa, or 1 � cups cooked leftover quinoa. Here�s
      how to cook quinoa.<br>

      *TOMATO NOTE: Use the most ripe and red tomatoes you can find! If you�re making this salad when tomatoes aren�t in
      season, cherry tomatoes might be your best bet.<br>
