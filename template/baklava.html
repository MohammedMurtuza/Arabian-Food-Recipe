      Instructions
      Prep:<br><br>

      Thaw phyllo dough by package instructions (this is best done overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter
      for 1 hr before starting your recipe to bring it to room temp).<br><br>
      Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking dish. My phyllo package had 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets that measured
      9x14 so I had to trim them slightly. You can trim one stack at a time then cover with a damp towel to keep from
      drying out.<br><br>
      Butter the bottom and sides of a 13x9 non-stick baking pan.<br><br>
      Start with your honey sauce (which needs time to cool as baklava bakes).<br><br>
      In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, and 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil
      over med/high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then reduce heat to med/low and boil additional 4 min
      without stirring. Remove from heat and let syrup cool while preparing baklava.<br><br>
      How to make Baklava: Preheat Oven to 325�F.<br><br>
      Pulse walnuts 10 times in a food process or until coarsely ground/ finely chopped. In a medium bowl, stir
      together: 4 cups finely chopped walnuts and 1 tsp cinnamon.<br><br>
      Place 10 phyllo sheets into baking pan one at a time, brushing each sheet with butter once it's in the pan before
      adding the next (i.e. place phyllo sheet into pan, brush the top with butter, place next phyllo sheet in pan,
      butter the top, etc. etc.). Keep remaining phyllo covered with a damp towel at all times. Spread about 1/5 of nut
      mixture (about 3/4 cup) over phyllo dough.<br><br>
      Add 5 buttered sheets of phyllo, then another layer of nuts. Repeat x 4. Finish off with 10 layers of buttered
      phyllo sheets. Brush the very top with butter.<br><br>
      Cut pastry into 1 1/2" wide strips, then cut diagonally to form diamond shapes. Bake at 325�F for 1 hour and 15
      min or until tops are golden brown.<br><br>
      Remove from oven and immediately spoon cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava (you'll hear it sizzle). This will
      ensure that it stays crisp rather than soggy. Let baklava cool completely, uncovered and at room temp. For best
      results, let baklava sit 4-6 hours or overnight at room temperature for the syrup to penetrate and soften the
      layers. Garnish baklava with finely chopped nuts or drizzle with melted chocolate. Store at room temp, covered
      with a tea towel for 1 to 2 weeks.<br><br>
